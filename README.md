# TheClimbingApp

Plan is to have the features merged into dev and then once a week maybe fortnightly we will then merge from dev, (Given that the code is working) into main to as a way to store version history. 

Ticklist for merge Request:

✅ Camel Case <br>
✅ Seperate Fork for feature <br>
✅ Being merged into Dev Only <br>
✅ Merge Request to be done by a different member of the team <br>
✅ Well documented Code <br>

If reviewer doesn’t understand the code, **DO NOT MERGE**. Communication is key
Please communicate with positive feedback

We are using Agile methodologies, Things will change and update please communicate any issues at all.
Lets all help eachother and try our best
