## Github read me roughly:

**TheClimbingApp**

Plan is to have the features merged into dev and then once a week maybe fortnightly we will then merge from dev, (Given that the code is working) into main to as a way to store version history.

Tick-list for merge Request:

✅ Camel Case <br>
✅ Separate Fork for feature <br>
✅ Being merged into Dev Only <br>
✅ Merge Request to be done by a different member of the team <br>
✅ Well documented Code <br>
✅  If solving issue, Have the issue code in the Merge Title and/or description <br>

If reviewer doesn’t understand the code, **DO NOT MERGE**. Communication is key Please communicate with positive feedback

We are using Agile methodologies, Things will change and update please communicate any issues at all. Lets all help each other and try our best

If an issue is found, Please create ‘New issue’ will details / plan and who is needed to fix the issue
