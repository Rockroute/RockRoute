## Logging in: Pre-existing user

When the the application opens, the first page is a login screen with a box for an email and a password as well as a check box for showing the password, the login button and a button for creating an account.


This page is for users already with an account to sign in with the email address and password they created it with. Clicking the “Show password” check box will turn the password from the asterisks it originally shows as to plain English. If the email and password match an account, the “Login” button will take you to the main page.

---

## Logging in: New user

If you do not have an account, clicking the “Create an account” button will open a new window for you to create one.


Here there is space to input a username, email address and password along with a check box for showing the passwords, a create account button to process the account and a button to return to the login page if you have an account.

The passwords in the two password boxes must match and the email address must not be associated with an already existing account for you to successfully create your account. If that is all correct, the “Create an account” button will create your account and take you the login page to login with the new email and password see **Logging in: Pre-existing user.**

If you are mistakenly on this page and you already have an account, the “Already got an account?” button will take you back to the login page.

---

## Main page: Overview

Once you have either created an account or logged in successfully, the main page will show, including three tabs along the top and a logout button at the bottom.


The tabs are a home tab, a search tab and a logbook tab. Clicking each will take you to the corresponding page.

The logout button will close the main tab and return you to the login page and require you to log in again or create a new account to return to the main page. This button remains in the same place across each of the tabs.


---

## Main page: Adding an activity

This tab includes a quick way to add an activity to the logbook with only a type, description, date and image. Underneath there are recommendations for nearby climbs that the user might like in a scroll down menu.


---


The recommendations have a list of climbs suggested for the user to do, with each climb having a drop down to allow the user to obtain information about each climb such as Location, Description, Type and Grade.


---

## Search page: Overview

This page shows a world map and all the climbing routes available as pins. In addition a list of the same climbs is available below the map to facilitate searching through and ease of viewing information.


---

## Search page: Generating a route

Your current position is designated as a blue circle which will change based on your current location. (Currently in the Location it is for the purpose of demonstration) 

Click on a blue pin on a climb or alternatively this can be achieved via clicking on the find button at the side of each of the desired climb in the climbs list:

This will generate a route from your position to the selected climb.

## Search page: Viewing Climbs information and adding to playlists

To view a climb either click on a pin on the map to get information about the specific climb or the list of climbs below the map view, this contains climbs with a drop-down showing you the name of the climb as well as the parent sector, the description, the location in latitude-longitude coordinates, the grade, the type and the protection notes by clicking the arrow on the right. 


This will display the information about the climb:


The search bar allows you to search for names of climbs which it will then bring up in the list, ranked by mostly closely fitting.


To the right of the search bar there is a way to select the playlists you have made in the logbook tab. See **Logbook page: Creating new playlists** for more information.


To add a Climb to a specific playlist this can be achieved by clicking the plus button on the desired climb to add to the currently selected playlist - in this case “Cedar Rapids”.

## Logbook page: Creating new playlists

This page shows the playlists you have created and allows creation of new ones.


You can click on any playlist or the associated drop-down arrow on the right, and it will open to show the climbs in that playlist along with any collaborators on it and a picture if you have added one. In this case “Cedar Rapids” is empty as a demonstration.


The box at the top of the page allows you to fill in the name of a new playlist in the “Playlist-Name” field along with other fields such as collaborator ID and the ability to add an image.


Clicking on the plus or minus buttons next to  the “Collaborator-ID” field allows entry of other User Ids to join the playlist. This will make the playlist available for them to edit and see:


Clicking on the image button allows an addition of an image. Once you have filled in all the desired fields, clicking “Make-Playlist” will create the new playlist.

Clicking the “Refresh” button at the bottom of the list of playlists will ensure the page is displaying up-to date playlists, such as newly created playlists or added climbs.
